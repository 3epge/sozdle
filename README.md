_Inspiration:_
As a daily Wordle player, I wondered if a Kazakh version existed and discovered [wordle.kz](https://wordle.kz). What began as a curiosity became a cherished daily routine with my dad. Wanting to share this joy with family members who learned Kazakh in Arabic script, I adapted [Hannah Park](https://www.hannahmariepark.com)’s open-source React implementation to create this version.
