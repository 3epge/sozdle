# Sozdle (Kazakh Wordle) in Arabic Script

- [Play](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) the real Wordle
- [Play](https://wordle.kz) the Wordle in Kazakh Cyrillic

_Inspiration:_
As a daily Wordle player, I wondered if a Kazakh version existed—and discovered [wordle.kz](https://wordle.kz). What began as a curiosity became a cherished daily ritual with my father. Wanting to share this joy with family who learned Kazakh in Arabic script, I adapted [Hannah Park](https://www.hannahmariepark.com)’s open-source React implementation to create this version.

_To Run Locally:_
